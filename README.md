# Predcting Fetal Deseases With Machine Learning

This project is the final progeject for the course in Data Science I took from 'Start to Impact'.

Here I'm analyzing some data reated to women's gestation and use Machine Learning to predict if the fetuses may develop some deseases.
The problem is a multi-class classification with three classes: 'normal', 'suspect', 'abnormal'.

After performing some EDA, I've developed a study subdivided in two phases:

1) I've left all the features and studied three ML models
2) I've performed some features selection and studied (the same) three ML models

In the end, I've compared these two phases and chosen the best ML model.

The Notebook is very well commented, but you may find helpful a deep explanatory article:
