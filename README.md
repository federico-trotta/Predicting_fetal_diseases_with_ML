# Studying a Fetal Dataset to Make Predictions With Machine Learning

In this project, I've analyzed some data related to women's gestation and used Machine Learning to predict if the fetuses may develop some diseases.
The problem is a multi-class classification with three classes: 'normal', 'suspect', 'abnormal'.

After performing some EDA, I've developed a study subdivided in two phases:

1) I've left all the features and studied three ML models
2) I've performed some feature selection and studied (the same) three ML models

In the end, I've compared these two phases and chosen the best ML model.

The Notebook is very well commented, but you may find helpful a deep explanatory article:

> **DISCLAIMER**: 
> - The dataset has been given me durying a course in Data Science and I do not know its source.
> - Please, consider this just as a study for the purpose of understanding ML concepts and models: this is not a medical study and no medical/health suggestions can derive from it
> - The Author of this study has no responsibility on any medical/health thoughts you may have and on any medical/health conclusion you may derive from this study

## The main ideas behind this project
If you are not "a technician" or if you just want to understand the main concepts without reading the code, you can take a look at the PDF I created:
