# Predicting Fetal Deseases With Machine Learning

In this project I've analyzed some data related to women's gestation and use Machine Learning to predict if the fetuses may develop some deseases.
The problem is a multi-class classification with three classes: 'normal', 'suspect', 'abnormal'.

After performing some EDA, I've developed a study subdivided in two phases:

1) I've left all the features and studied three ML models
2) I've performed some features selection and studied (the same) three ML models

In the end, I've compared these two phases and chosen the best ML model.

The Notebook is very well commented, but you may find helpful a deep explanatory article:

## The main ideas behind this project
If you are not "a technician" or if you just want to understand the main concepts without reading the code, you can take a look at the PDF I created:
